        <h2>College Grades</h2>
        <p>During my first academic year, I diligently immersed myself in textbooks and relied on ample cups of coffee to navigate the challenging coursework. This commitment manifested in a commendable 9 GPA, despite my tendency to spend extensive periods in the library. Moving into the second year, real-world responsibilities influenced a slight dip in my academic performance to an 8.34 GPA. While not an achievement I boast about, it signifies a resilient effort to stay afloat. As I embark on my third year, my commitment remains unwavering, albeit with a reduced reliance on caffeine, aiming for a further enhancement of my academic standing.</p>

        <p>I've experimented with embedded systems in my projects, concentrating on the Arduino Uno platform. Even though I don't think of myself as very adept, I've started a number of projects that showcase my interest and practical experience. Through the use of Arduino, I have attempted projects ranging from simple to more complicated, delving into the fundamentals of hardware programming and electronic design. In addition, I've experimented with building Python scripts to get familiar with the language and develop my knowledge. I have made some basic python games and learned some DSA.</p>
